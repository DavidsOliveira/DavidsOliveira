Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, from Portugal.
I'm 19 years old and currently finishing my first year of college, studying Electronics and Computer Engineering.

I mainly program in C++ and C, and I'm starting to explore x86 Assembly, with a growing interest in hardware-software interaction.

I'm planning to work on various projects to improve my skills and eventually master low-level programming.

Any comments, feedback, or help are always welcome!
